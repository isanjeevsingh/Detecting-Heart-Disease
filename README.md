## Detecting Heart Disease 

This repository carries the code and a pdf report for detecting heart disease by considering a set of underlying factors.
The below abstract throws more light on the completed project.

## Abstract
Heart diseases or cardiovascular disease (CVD) are widely known, and many people suffer from it. CVD includes Angina causing chest pain, Heart Attack, Congenital Heart Disease, and several others. A few of the underlying factors that relate to heart diseases are lack of exercise, obesity, high blood cholesterol, high blood pressure, and others. Knowing that it is the leading cause of death across the world, we took this study to explore what significant factors we can relate to the presence of heart disease. Getting early signals of the presence of CVD can help save lives.

In our study, we investigated several factors associated with CVD and narrowed down to critical ones that helped detect the presence of the disease. To eliminate features, we used Bayesian methodology and used Laplace Prior that makes non-essential factor effect to zero. Our final model shows that out of 18 attributes, Sex, High blood pressure in women, asymptomatic chest pain (Angina), and Irreversible Thalassemia were significant predictors of CVD. Being a simpler model with less variable, our generalized model performed better than the baseline model on the test data set with an AUC score of 86%.
